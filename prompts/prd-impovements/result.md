Perfect! I've updated both documents to include your language proficiency:

PRD Updates:

Added new Epic 4: Languages with user story for displaying language proficiency
Shows Bosnian as "Native" and English as "Full Professional Proficiency"
Renumbered subsequent epics (Technologies is now Epic 5, Projects is Epic 6, etc.)
Content Structure Updates:

Added Language Types with TypeScript interface and proficiency enum
Added Languages Content section with example data for Bosnian (native) and English (professional)
Included example component showing how to display languages with optional flag icons
Updated file organization to include language.ts and languages.ts files
The languages section will appear between Education and Technologies, making it easy for recruiters to see your multilingual capabilities—especially valuable for international roles.
