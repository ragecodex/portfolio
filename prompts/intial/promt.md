I am a software engineer and I would like to build a portfolio website for myself. Portfolio needs to be simple with a few sections in a beautifull design, showing my main quality/values, my education, experience together with my current possition, list of techonologies/cloud providers I have been working with so far and the list of projects I did in the past showcasing challenges I solved in various technologies/architectures. As a start I want you to build me a product requirements document (prd) in markdown format. 

To do that, first do some deep analysis of some existing portfolio websites for software engineers. Try to find out which are considered to have beautifull design, but also focused on clarity when it comes to presenting information. Based on that try to come up with a solution for me that is simple, has beautiful design but also is very clear in transfering information about me, my skills, experience etc. Ask me questions about anything that is not clear enough. Also, below are some technical details about the porftfolio app. Based on those think about what is the best and cheapest solution for hosting this portfolio website.

Here are some high level technical details:
- Implementation needs to be done in NextJs
- Everything related to static information, I mentioned above, needs to be prebuild during deployment. This is important for SEO
- In the future I plan to add some dynamic pages with some blog posts or something like that. We do not want to implement this as of now, in the firts phase (MVP), just have it in mind for initial application setup.
