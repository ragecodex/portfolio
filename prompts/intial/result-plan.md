Build a minimalist, SEO-optimized portfolio website for Ragib Smajic using Next.js with Static Site Generation, showcasing 8 years of experience, 10-15 technologies, and 3-5 key projects in a modern gray/dark color scheme targeting recruiters and clients.

Steps:

- Create PRD structure covering product vision, target audience (recruiters/hiring managers, potential clients), and core value proposition (value-focused problem solver with engineer mindset)

- Define feature specifications for six main sections: Hero/Introduction highlighting core values (value-focused, problem solver, engineer mindset, technology enthusiast), Experience timeline (8 years, 2 companies, roles including Senior Software Engineer/Tech Lead), Education, Technologies grid (10-15 items with logos), Projects showcase (3-5 projects with challenge/solution narratives), and Footer with social links/email

- Specify design system with minimalist principles using gray/dark base colors (charcoal, slate, dark gray backgrounds), white/light gray text, accent colors for CTAs and logos, modern typography (sans-serif like Inter or Geist), generous whitespace, and subtle animations for professional feel

- Document technical architecture for Next.js 14+ using App Router with Static Site Generation (SSG), TypeScript for type safety, Tailwind CSS for styling, content structure using TypeScript interfaces or JSON files for easy updates, and image optimization via Next.js Image component

- Recommend hosting solution using Vercel (free tier) for zero-cost deployment with automatic HTTPS, global CDN, instant rollbacks, GitHub integration for CI/CD, and custom domain support for ragibsmajic.com via Cloudflare DNS

- Plan for future extensibility by structuring content folder (/content or /data) to separate static portfolio data from future dynamic blog, setting up routing conventions (/blog reserved), and implementing component architecture that separates portfolio sections from future blog components
